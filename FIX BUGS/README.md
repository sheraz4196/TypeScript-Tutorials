# Typescript for beginner

This module of the repository is for beginners who have just started learning typescript. Its great to hear that you are here. Here you'll find all the basic knowledge about Typescript.

## How to run the project?

All you have to do is to open Problem directory in the terminal and run `npm install`, you will be good then. Same goes for the Solution module.
I'll suggest when you have learnt the concept clearly, delete that exercise from you computer, and just have it on github. Because it might consume storage, that is not good for you if you work on small computers!!

## How to take this module?

- There are exercises in this module, each exercise has a Problem and Solution directory.In the problems, there will be some buggy typescript code inside index.ts file. Try to resolve it yourself first.
- If you were not lucky enough to resolve it yourself, read th README.md file in the solution directory. there will be explained solution about the bugs.
- If you were not able to understand even then you can see the index.ts file in the solution directory.
